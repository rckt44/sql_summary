proc sql;
create table aa as 
select sum(count(distinct varname),8) from tablename
where varname is not null ;
quit;
/*note summing up without numeric formats will result in errors such as 
ERROR: Summary functions nested in this way are not supported.*/
for example ,
if you do,
proc sql;
create table bb as
select sum(count(distinct varname)) from tablename
where varname is not null;
quit;
/*this will result in error*/
